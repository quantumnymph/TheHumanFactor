THE HUMAN FACTOR

you can find the game at https://quantumnymph.github.io/TheHumanFactor/

The human factor is a proposed old-school style text adventure game series made as a school project. Its goal is to analyse the answers users will give when certain choices are put into an elaborate context and compare them with expected, context-less decisions. 

It was made with the help of squiffy: an amazing opensource tool written in JavaScript, which assists with making the logic of your game function and provides ready-to-use JS code, as well as HTML for web. You can find out more on their github or on textadventures.co.uk. 

The data storage is serverless, with Zapier (not implemented yet).
